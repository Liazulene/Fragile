abstract="In this chapter, the van de Pol oscillator model is reviewed. The van der Pol oscillator model is an approximation valid for a fairly wide class of oscillators. In practice, this is the only oscillator for which the oscillator harmonics distortion was calculated analytically. Using the harmonics amplitudes, one can find a very important performance parameter, the total harmonic distortion (THD). We describe here how the oscillator can be represented by the corresponding van der Pol model. We give the amplitude calculations, compare the results of calculations and simulations and discuss the results.",

abstract = {Abstract In this work it is shown that by a series of transformations the classical Van der Pol oscillator can be exactly reduced to Abel's equations of the second kind. The absence of exact analytic solutions in terms of known (tabulated) functions of the reduced equations leads to the conclusion that there are no exact solutions of the Van der Pol oscillator in terms of known (tabulated) functions. In the limits or small or large values of the parameter ϵ the reduced equations are amenable to asymptotic analysis. For the case of large values of the parameter (relaxation oscillations) an analytic solution to the problem is provided that is exact up to O(ϵ-2).},
